# Deep Reinforcement Learning Repository

This project contains various deep reinforcement learning methods. The methods are implemented in Python using tensorflow.
Implemented methods:
- [Continuous Deep Q-Learning with Model-based Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00748)
- [Continuous control with deep reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971)
- [Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/abs/nature14236.html) (in progress)
